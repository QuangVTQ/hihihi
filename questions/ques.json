--Eating Disorders--
'{
    "q1": "Do you experience a sense of a "loss of control" over your eating? 
    This can mean feeling unable to stop eating once you've started, 
    or eating an amount of food that feels objectively large in a discrete period of time.",
    //if yes: BINGEEATING -> q1a
    //if no: q2
    "q1a":"Following these episodes of loss-of-control eating, do you engage in recurrent, inappropriate "compensatory behaviors" to prevent weight gain? 
    (e.g., self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives/diuretics/enemas, fasting, or excessive exercise).",
    //if yes: BULIMIA_NERVOSA
    //if no: Binge eating disorder
    "q2": "Despite being at a significantly low weight, is there an intense fear of gaining weight and a disturbed perception of your body 
    (e.g., seeing yourself as fat, or your self-worth being overly tied to your weight)?",
    //If YES:** This aligns with the core criteria for **Anorexia Nervosa**. A sub-type would then be determined (Restricting type or Binge-Eating/Purging type).
   //If NO:** The significant weight loss without the characteristic fear of weight gain may indicate **ARFID** or another medical condition, and a medical evaluation is crucial.
   "q3": "Do you engage in compensatory behaviors (like self-induced vomiting, laxative misuse, or excessive exercise) to control your weight or shape, 
   but these occur after eating normal or small amounts of food (and not as a compensation for a binge)?",
   //If YES: This pattern aligns with the diagnosis of Purging Disorder.
   "q4":"Do you chew and then spit out food instead of swallowing it to avoid calorie intake or due to fears about the food?",
    //If YES: This is a recognized disordered behavior that may be part of another eating disorder or classified under OSFED.
    "q5":" Are the primary concerns about food and eating related to avoidance based on sensory characteristics (texture, smell), a lack of interest in eating, or a fear of negative consequences like choking or vomitingâ€”rather than a concern about body weight or shape?",
    //If YES: This pattern strongly points to Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID).
    "q6": "Do your thoughts and behaviors around food, weight, and body image cause you significant distress and impair your life, but do not fully match the patterns described above? (For example, all the symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa but weight is not in the "significantly low" range, or all the symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa but at a lower frequency).",
    //If YES: This is incredibly common and falls under the diagnostic category of Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED). It is no less serious or deserving of treatment than the more specifically named disorders.
